Subject: Legal Consultation: Fintech Payment Platform - Need to Make It Legal

Dear [Attorney's Name],

I'm launching a fintech startup called Shot On Me and need legal guidance to ensure I'm compliant before launch.

WHAT I DO:
Shot On Me is a payment platform where users send money to friends that can only be spent at participating venues. Money is held in escrow until used at venues via virtual cards.

MY LEGAL QUESTIONS:
1. Do I need a money transmitter license? (I live in Indianapolis, banking in Texas)
2. Is my escrow model legal? (holding funds, no withdrawal option)
3. Can I restrict where money is spent? (only approved venues)
4. What licenses/registrations do I need?
5. What legal documents do I need? (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy)

I need to understand the legal requirements before I can launch. I have a detailed document explaining my business model and questions.

Can we schedule a consultation this week? Please let me know your availability and consultation fee.

Thank you!
