- Connected to local backend at `localhost:5000`

### 2. **www.shotonme.com** - Production
**URL:** https://www.shotonme.com
- This is your **production deployment**
- Should show the same app, but you mentioned it's "completely different"
- Connected to production backend at `shot-on-me.onrender.com`
