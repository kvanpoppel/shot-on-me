# ⏰ When Should You Purchase the Desktop?

## 🎯 Quick Answer

### **You DON'T Need to Buy Immediately** ✅

**You can continue working on your current setup** - the desktop is an upgrade, not a requirement.

**However, buy when:**
1. **You're ready to scale up** (more development work)
2. **Current computer is struggling** (slow, crashes, memory issues)
3. **You find a good deal** (sales, limited stock)
4. **You have the budget** ($390-400)

## 📊 Current Situation Analysis

### **What You Have Now:**
- Working development environment
- All 4 servers running (backend, shot-on-me, venue-portal, owner-portal)
- Project is functional

### **When You'll NEED the Upgrade:**
- ❌ **Not immediately** - current setup works
- ✅ **When you add more features** (more servers, heavier workloads)
- ✅ **When current computer slows down** (memory issues, crashes)
- ✅ **When you want better performance** (faster development)

## ⏰ Best Times to Purchase

### **1. When Stock is Available (Now)**
**Dell OptiPlex 7050 Mini Tower:**
- Currently available at Best Buy
- Price: $390.31
- **Action:** Check availability now - if in stock, consider buying

**Why Buy Now:**
- ✅ Good price
- ✅ Limited stock (might sell out)
- ✅ Ready when you need it

**Why Wait:**
- ❌ Current setup works fine
- ❌ Can save money for other priorities
- ❌ Might find better deal later

---

### **2. When You're Ready to Scale (1-3 months)**
**Signs You're Ready:**
- Adding more features to the app
- More complex development work
- Current computer showing signs of strain
- Planning to work more hours on development

**Best Time:** When you start feeling limited by current setup

---

### **3. During Sales (Black Friday, Back to School)**
**Best Sales Periods:**
- **Black Friday / Cyber Monday** (November) - Biggest discounts
- **Back to School** (August-September) - Good deals
- **New Year Sales** (January) - Clearance deals
- **Prime Day** (July) - Amazon deals

**Potential Savings:** 10-20% off ($40-80 savings)

**Trade-off:** Wait 2-6 months, might miss current stock

---

### **4. When Current Computer Fails**
**Emergency Purchase:**
- Current computer breaks
- Can't work without it
- Need immediate replacement

**Not Ideal:** Rushed purchase, might pay more, limited options

---

## 💰 Budget Considerations

### **Can You Afford It Now?**
- **Yes:** Consider buying now (good price, available stock)
- **No:** Wait until you have budget ($390-400)
- **Maybe:** Save for 1-2 months, then buy

### **Priority Ranking:**
1. **Essential:** Domain name, hosting (when launching)
2. **Important:** Desktop upgrade (when scaling)
3. **Nice to Have:** Better monitor, keyboard, etc.

**Desktop is "Important" but not "Essential" right now.**
