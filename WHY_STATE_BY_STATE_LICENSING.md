# Why You Need a Money Transmitter License in Each State

**Understanding State-by-State Licensing Requirements**

---

## THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON: STATE SOVEREIGNTY

### Each State Has Its Own Laws

**The Legal Reality:**
- Each U.S. state is a **sovereign entity** with its own laws
- States have the **constitutional right** to regulate commerce within their borders
- Money transmission is considered **intrastate commerce** (within state borders)
- States can require licenses for businesses operating in their jurisdiction

**Think of it like:**
- Driver's licenses - each state issues its own
- Business licenses - each state requires its own
- Professional licenses (lawyers, doctors) - each state licenses separately
- **Money transmitter licenses - same concept**

## WHAT "OPERATING" MEANS - THE KEY QUESTION

### You're Operating in a State If:

**1. You Have Users in That State**
- User registers with address in that state
- User adds funds from that state
- User sends/receives money while in that state
- **Result:** You're facilitating money transmission in that state

**2. You Have Venues in That State**
- Venue is located in that state
- Venue accepts payments from your platform
- Money flows to venue in that state
- **Result:** You're transmitting money to recipients in that state

**3. You Process Transactions Involving That State**
- Sender is in State A, recipient is in State B
- **Both states** may require licenses
- Transaction crosses state lines
- **Result:** You may need licenses in both states

### The Critical Point

**It's NOT about where YOUR business is located.**
- Your business could be in Indiana
- But if you have users in Ohio, you're operating in Ohio
- If you have venues in Illinois, you're operating in Illinois
- **Each state where you have users/venues = need license**

## LEGAL BASIS - WHY STATES CAN REQUIRE THIS

### 1. Consumer Protection

**States' Rationale:**
- Protect residents from fraud
- Ensure businesses have adequate reserves
- Require bonding to cover losses
- Mandate compliance programs

**Example:**
- If an Ohio user loses money due to fraud
- Ohio wants to ensure you have:
  - Bond to cover losses
  - Reserves to pay claims
  - Compliance program to prevent fraud
  - State oversight to investigate issues

### 2. Financial Stability

**States' Rationale:**
- Ensure you can pay users if you go out of business
- Require minimum net worth
- Mandate reserve requirements
- Protect against insolvency

**Example:**
- If you hold $1 million in user funds
- States want assurance you have:
  - $1 million+ in reserves
  - Bond to cover shortfalls
  - Financial reporting to state

### 3. Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

**States' Rationale:**
- Prevent money laundering
- Require AML compliance programs
- Mandate suspicious activity reporting
- Enable state oversight

**Example:**
- If criminal uses your platform in California
- California wants to ensure:
  - You verify user identity (KYC)
  - You monitor transactions
  - You report suspicious activity
  - State can investigate

### 4. Revenue Generation

**States' Rationale:**
- License fees generate revenue
- Annual renewals provide ongoing revenue
- Regulatory oversight costs money
- Fees offset state costs

**Reality:** States charge fees to cover regulatory costs

## THE CONSEQUENCES OF OPERATING WITHOUT A LICENSE

### Criminal Penalties

**Possible Consequences:**
- **Fines:** $1,000-$100,000+ per violation
- **Criminal Charges:** Misdemeanor or felony (depending on state)
- **Jail Time:** Up to 5+ years in some states
- **Cease and Desist:** Must stop operating immediately

**Example Cases:**
- Ripple Labs: $700,000 fine for operating without license
- BitPay: $1.8 million fine
- Multiple companies: Criminal charges filed

### Civil Penalties

**Possible Consequences:**
- **User Lawsuits:** Users can sue for operating illegally
- **State Lawsuits:** Attorney General can file suit
- **Class Actions:** Multiple users can join together
- **Damages:** Must refund all transactions + penalties

### Business Consequences

**Possible Consequences:**
- **Shutdown:** Forced to stop operations
- **Reputation Damage:** Public disclosure of violations
- **Bank Account Closure:** Banks may close accounts
- **Payment Processor Termination:** Stripe may terminate relationship
- **Future Licensing:** Harder to get licenses later

## ARE THERE ANY EXCEPTIONS?

### 1. Federal Preemption? **NO**

**Question:** Does federal law override state requirements?

**Answer:** **NO**
- Federal law (FinCEN) requires registration
- But states can ALSO require licenses
- Federal registration ≠ state license exemption
- You need BOTH federal registration AND state licenses

### 2. Stripe's License Covers Me? **NO**

**Question:** Stripe has licenses, doesn't that cover me?

**Answer:** **NO**
- Stripe is a **payment processor**
- You are a **money transmitter**
- Stripe's license covers Stripe's activities
- **Your** license covers **your** activities
- You're the one holding user funds
- You're the one transmitting money

**Analogy:**
- Stripe = the truck (payment processor)
- You = the shipping company (money transmitter)
- Truck has license plates (Stripe's license)
- But shipping company needs business license (your license)

### 3. Small Volume Exception? **RARE**

**Question:** What if I have very few users in a state?

**Answer:** **Usually NO exception**
- Most states require license regardless of volume
- Some states have de minimis exceptions (very small amounts)
- But exceptions are rare and limited
- **Don't rely on exceptions**

**Example Exceptions (rare):**
- Some states: < $1,000/month = no license
- But most states: Any amount = license required

### 4. "I'm Just a Platform" Exception? **NO**

**Question:** I'm just providing technology, not transmitting money myself?

**Answer:** **NO**
- If you hold user funds = money transmitter
- If you facilitate transfers = money transmitter
- If you control the money flow = money transmitter
- "Just a platform" doesn't exempt you

**Your Model:**
- You hold funds in your account ✅ = Money transmitter
- You facilitate transfers ✅ = Money transmitter
- You control money flow ✅ = Money transmitter
- **No exception applies**

## STATE-BY-STATE REQUIREMENTS - THE REALITY

### How States Determine If You Need a License

**States Look At:**
1. **Where users are located** (registration address)
2. **Where transactions occur** (sender/receiver location)
3. **Where venues are located** (recipient location)
4. **Where money is received** (funding location)
5. **Where money is paid out** (venue location)

### Your Specific Situation

**If you launch in Indiana only:**
- ✅ Users must be in Indiana
- ✅ Venues must be in Indiana
- ✅ Transactions must be Indiana-to-Indiana
- ✅ **Only need Indiana license**

**If you expand:**
- User in Ohio registers → Need Ohio license
- Venue in Illinois signs up → Need Illinois license
- User in Indiana sends to user in Ohio → Need both licenses
- **Each state = separate license**

---

## THE PRACTICAL APPROACH

### Strategy 1: Single State Launch (Recommended)

**Start in Indiana Only:**
- Get Indiana license
- Restrict users to Indiana (location verification)
- Restrict venues to Indiana (approval process)
- Block out-of-state transactions
- **Cost:** One license (~$67K-$133K first year)

**Expand Later:**
- As revenue grows, add states
- Get licenses for states you want to enter
- Add location restrictions for new states
- **Cost:** Additional licenses as you expand

### Strategy 2: Multi-State Launch

**Launch in Multiple States:**
- Get licenses in all target states upfront
- Higher initial cost
- Faster expansion
- **Cost:** $67K-$133K × number of states

**Example:**
- Indiana + Ohio + Illinois
- = 3 licenses
- = $201K-$399K first year

### Strategy 3: Partner with Licensed Provider

**Use a Licensed Partner:**
- Partner holds the license
- You operate under their license
- They handle compliance
- **Cost:** Revenue share (10-30%)

**Trade-offs:**
- Lower upfront cost
- But give up revenue share
- Less control over compliance

## WHY CAN'T YOU JUST GET ONE LICENSE?

### The Legal Answer

**States Don't Recognize Other States' Licenses:**
- Each state has its own regulatory authority
- States don't have "reciprocity" agreements
- License in Indiana ≠ license in Ohio
- **Each state requires its own license**

**Why No Reciprocity?**
- States want to:
  - Verify your financials themselves
  - Ensure you meet their specific requirements
  - Have direct oversight over you
  - Collect their own fees

### The Practical Answer

**It's About Jurisdiction:**
- Indiana can only regulate Indiana operations
- Ohio can only regulate Ohio operations
- Illinois can only regulate Illinois operations
- **Each state regulates its own jurisdiction**

**If you operate in multiple states:**
- You're subject to multiple jurisdictions
- Each jurisdiction requires its own license
- **No way around it legally**

## WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU IGNORE THIS?

### Scenario: Launch in Indiana, User from Ohio Signs Up

**What Happens:**
1. Ohio user registers (you don't verify location)
2. Ohio user adds funds
3. Ohio user sends money
4. **You're now operating in Ohio without a license**

**Possible Consequences:**
- Ohio Attorney General investigates
- Receives complaint or discovers violation
- Issues cease and desist order
- Files lawsuit
- Fines: $10,000-$100,000+
- Criminal charges possible
- Must refund all Ohio transactions
- **Your business could be shut down**

### The Risk Is Real

**Recent Examples:**
- **Ripple Labs:** Fined $700K for operating without licenses
- **BitPay:** Fined $1.8M for operating without licenses
- **Multiple crypto companies:** Shut down for operating without licenses
- **Payment apps:** Fined millions for state violations

**States ARE enforcing this:**
- States actively monitor for violations
- Competitors may report you
- Users may file complaints
- **You will be caught eventually**

## RECOMMENDATION

**Start in Indiana Only:**
1. Get Indiana money transmitter license
2. Implement strict location verification
3. Block out-of-state users and venues
4. Build revenue in Indiana
5. Expand to additional states as revenue grows
6. Get additional licenses as you expand

**This approach:**
- ✅ Minimizes initial cost
- ✅ Reduces compliance complexity
- ✅ Allows you to learn in one state
- ✅ Builds revenue to fund expansion
- ✅ Keeps you legal and compliant

**Don't:**
- ❌ Launch in multiple states without licenses
- ❌ Hope states won't notice
- ❌ Rely on exceptions
- ❌ Assume Stripe's license covers you
