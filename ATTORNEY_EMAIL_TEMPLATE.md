## EMAIL BODY (Enhanced Version):

**Subject:** Consultation Request Regarding LLC Registration and Fintech Compliance

Dear [Attorney's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am the founder of **Shot On Me**, a social payment platform facilitating peer-to-peer money transfers for use at participating venues. We are making significant progress in our development and are eager to ensure compliance as we move forward.

I am reaching out to schedule a consultation regarding several legal matters related to my business, particularly the formation and registration of an LLC in a state where I do not reside.

---

## KEY POINTS FOR DISCUSSION:

### 1. LLC REGISTRATION

**State Selection:** 
I am considering registering my LLC in **Delaware or Wyoming** due to their favorable business laws, low fees, and established reputation for protecting business interests. I would appreciate your guidance on which state would be best suited for a fintech startup like ours.

**Non-Resident Registration:** 
I understand that I can register my LLC without being a resident of the state, as long as I designate a registered agent with a physical address there. I would like to confirm this process and any additional requirements.

### 2. REGISTERED AGENT REQUIREMENTS

**Selection Process:** 
I would like guidance on how to choose a reliable registered agent service, including:
- What to look for in terms of experience and compliance with state regulations
- Are there specific registered agent services you recommend for fintech companies?
- Cost considerations and service quality

### 3. FILING PROCESS

**Articles of Organization:** 
Details on the specific requirements for filing the Articles of Organization and any additional documentation needed for Delaware or Wyoming.

**Employer Identification Number (EIN):** 
Steps to apply for an EIN and its implications for my business operations, particularly regarding our escrow account and payment processing.

### 4. COMPLIANCE AND TAX OBLIGATIONS

**Annual and Franchise Fees:** 
Clarification on the annual fees, franchise taxes, and reporting requirements specific to the selected state (Delaware or Wyoming).

**Foreign LLC Registration:** 
Advice on the process and requirements for registering as a foreign LLC if I conduct business in my home state or other states where we plan to operate.

### 5. MONEY TRANSMITTER LICENSE REQUIREMENTS

**Federal and State Licensing:** 
An overview of the steps necessary to obtain money transmitter licenses at both federal and state levels, including:
- FinCEN registration requirements
- State-by-state license requirements (particularly for states where users and venues are located)
- Compliance with AML/KYC regulations tailored to our business model
- How our escrow model and spending restrictions affect licensing requirements

### 6. ESCROW ACCOUNT LEGALITY

Our business model involves holding user funds in escrow until redemption at venues. I need guidance on:
- Legality of holding funds indefinitely with no withdrawal option
- Regulatory requirements for escrow accounts
- Whether we need a separate escrow account or can use our business account
- Reserve requirements and bonding obligations
- Interest on escrow funds

### 7. VIRTUAL CARD / TAP-AND-PAY COMPLIANCE

We issue virtual cards via Stripe Issuing that can only be used at approved venues. Questions include:
- Do we need licenses to issue virtual cards?
- Does Stripe's license cover our card issuance?
- Is it legal to restrict where cards can be used?
- Consumer protection considerations for restricted spending

### 8. VENUE PORTAL AND OWNER PAGE COMPLIANCE

**Venue Management:** 
The venue portal will allow participating venues to manage their profiles, payment settings, and customer interactions. Legal considerations include:
- Terms of service and user agreements for venues
- Venue onboarding and approval processes
- Data protection and privacy requirements
- Commission and fee structures

**Data Protection:** 
Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, particularly regarding:
- Customer data and transaction records accessible through the owner page
- GDPR and CCPA compliance
- Data retention and security requirements

### 9. SHOT ON ME PAGE CONSIDERATIONS

**User Experience:** 
The customer-facing Shot On Me page will have features for transaction processing, user agreements, and fee disclosures. I seek guidance on:
- Necessary legal disclosures for users
- Terms of Service requirements (particularly regarding escrow, spending restrictions, and no withdrawal policy)
- Privacy Policy compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- Fee disclosure requirements
- Refund and dispute resolution policies

### 10. GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS ON SPENDING

Our platform restricts spending to approved venues only. I need to understand:
- Legality of restricting where users can spend their money
- Consumer protection concerns
- Required disclosures to users
- Multi-state operation considerations

### 11. AML/KYC COMPLIANCE

Given we facilitate money transfers and hold funds in escrow, I need guidance on:
- AML program requirements
- KYC verification requirements
- Transaction limits and monitoring
- Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) obligations
- Record-keeping requirements

### 12. TAX AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

- 1099 filing requirements (for senders, recipients, venues?)
- Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) if transactions exceed $10,000
- Tax obligations for the platform
- Escrow interest tax implications

---

- Technical implementation details (Stripe Connect, Stripe Issuing)
