## ⚠️ Minor Notes (Non-Critical):

### npm Warnings:
- Some deprecated package warnings (normal, don't affect functionality)
- 1 high severity vulnerability (can be addressed later with `npm audit fix`)

**These don't prevent deployment or functionality!**

---

## ✅ Your App is Now Live!

### Production URLs:
- **Frontend**: `https://www.shotonme.com` ✅ **LIVE!**
- **Backend**: `https://api.shotonme.com` (or your Render URL)

---

## ⚠️ Remaining Action: Render PORT Fix

### Still Need to Fix:
- **Render PORT**: Change from `3000` → `5000`

**Why this matters:**
- Your backend needs to run on port 5000
- Current setting (3000) may cause connection issues

**Action:**
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service → Environment
2. Change `PORT=3000` to `PORT=5000`
3. Save (will trigger redeploy)

### ⚠️ Render:

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Test your live app:**
   - Visit: `https://www.shotonme.com`
   - Test login/registration
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Fix Render PORT:**
   - Change `PORT=3000` → `PORT=5000`
   - This ensures backend API works correctly

3. **Monitor:**
   - Vercel: Deployment successful ✅
   - Render: Fix PORT, then verify deployment
