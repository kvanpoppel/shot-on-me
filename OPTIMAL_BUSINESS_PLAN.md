## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Opportunity

**Shot On Me** is a social payment platform that combines peer-to-peer money transfers with venue discovery and social networking. Unlike traditional payment apps (Venmo, Cash App), Shot On Me restricts spending to participating venues, creating a unique value proposition for both users and venue owners.

### The Problem

- **For Users:** No easy way to send money specifically for venue experiences (drinks, food, events)
- **For Venues:** Limited tools to engage customers, drive foot traffic, and increase revenue
- **Market Gap:** No major player focuses on venue-specific payments with social features

### The Solution

Shot On Me enables users to:
- Send money to friends for use at venues
- Discover nearby venues and friends
- Share experiences through social feed
- Use funds via tap-and-pay virtual cards (no app required for recipients)

### Financial Strategy

**Recommended: Hybrid Bootstrap-to-Funding**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Bootstrap $75K → Launch in Texas → Validate product-market fit
- **Phase 2 (Months 7-12):** Seed Round $350K → Scale to 5-10 states → Reach profitability
- **Phase 3 (Year 2-3):** Series A $3M → National expansion → Market leadership

**Why This Strategy:**
- Minimizes dilution (30% vs. 45-60% with early funding)
- Maximizes valuation (3-4x better with traction)
- Maintains control during critical early phase
- Faster path to profitability

### Key Metrics (Year 1)

- **Users:** 25,000-50,000
- **Venues:** 100-200
- **Revenue:** $150,000-$300,000
- **Break-Even:** Month 9-12
- **Valuation (if raising):** $3M-$5M

### Investment Required

- **Phase 1:** $75,000 (bootstrap)
- **Phase 2:** $350,000 (seed round, 10-12% equity)
- **Phase 3:** $3,000,000 (Series A, 15-18% equity)
