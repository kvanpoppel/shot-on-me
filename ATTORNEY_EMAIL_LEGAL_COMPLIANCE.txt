Subject: Urgent: Legal Consultation Needed for Fintech Payment Platform Launch

Dear [Attorney's Name],

I am the founder of Shot On Me, a social payment platform that I'm preparing to launch. I need immediate legal guidance to ensure my business model is compliant before I begin operations.

ABOUT MY BUSINESS:
Shot On Me allows users to send money to friends for use at participating venues (bars, restaurants, clubs). Key aspects:
- Users send money via phone number
- Funds are held in escrow until redeemed at venues
- Recipients receive virtual cards (tap-and-pay) that can only be used at approved venues
- No bank withdrawal option for recipients
- Platform acts as intermediary, holding funds until venue redemption

MY IMMEDIATE LEGAL CONCERNS:

1. MONEY TRANSMITTER LICENSE REQUIREMENTS
   - Do I need a money transmitter license?
   - Which states require licenses? (I live in Indianapolis, plan to bank in Texas)
   - Does my escrow model change licensing requirements?
   - What's the fastest legal path to launch?

2. BUSINESS ENTITY FORMATION
   - Should I form LLC in Texas or Indiana?
   - I live in Indianapolis but can bank in Texas - what's best?
   - Do I need Foreign LLC registration?

3. ESCROW ACCOUNT LEGALITY
   - Is it legal to hold user funds indefinitely?
   - Can I prevent users from withdrawing to bank accounts?
   - What are the regulatory requirements?

4. VIRTUAL CARD ISSUANCE
   - Do I need licenses to issue virtual cards via Stripe Issuing?
   - Can I restrict where cards can be used (only approved venues)?

5. TERMS OF SERVICE & PRIVACY POLICY
   - What must be disclosed to users?
   - Required legal language for my business model?

6. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
   - AML/KYC requirements?
   - FinCEN registration?
   - State-specific requirements?

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

1. Legal opinion on whether my business model is legal
2. Step-by-step compliance roadmap
3. Cost estimates for licenses and legal setup
4. Timeline to legal launch
5. Risk assessment
6. Draft Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

TIMELINE:
I am ready to move forward immediately and need to understand legal requirements before accepting any payments or launching.

I have prepared a detailed consultation document (ATTORNEY_CONSULTATION_GUIDE.md) that explains my business model, payment flows, and specific legal questions.

I would like to schedule a consultation as soon as possible. Please let me know:
- Your availability (this week if possible)
- Your consultation fee
- Any additional information you need before our meeting

I understand this is urgent as I cannot proceed without proper legal guidance. I look forward to working with you to ensure Shot On Me is fully compliant.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
