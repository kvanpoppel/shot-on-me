Subject: Consultation Request Regarding LLC Registration and Fintech Compliance

Dear [Attorney's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am the founder of Shot On Me, a social payment platform facilitating peer-to-peer money transfers for use at participating venues. We are making significant progress in our development and are eager to ensure compliance as we move forward.

I am reaching out to schedule a consultation regarding several legal matters related to my business, particularly the formation and registration of an LLC in a state where I do not reside.

KEY POINTS FOR DISCUSSION:

1. LLC REGISTRATION:

State Selection: I am considering registering my LLC in Delaware or Wyoming due to their favorable business laws, low fees, and established reputation for protecting business interests. I would appreciate your guidance on which state would be best suited for a fintech startup like ours.

Non-Resident Registration: I understand that I can register my LLC without being a resident of the state, as long as I designate a registered agent with a physical address there. I would like to confirm this process and any additional requirements.

2. REGISTERED AGENT REQUIREMENTS:

Selection Process: I would like guidance on how to choose a reliable registered agent service, including what to look for in terms of experience and compliance with state regulations. Are there specific registered agent services you recommend for fintech companies?

3. FILING PROCESS:

Articles of Organization: Details on the specific requirements for filing the Articles of Organization and any additional documentation needed for Delaware or Wyoming.

Employer Identification Number (EIN): Steps to apply for an EIN and its implications for my business operations, particularly regarding our escrow account and payment processing.

4. COMPLIANCE AND TAX OBLIGATIONS:

Annual and Franchise Fees: Clarification on the annual fees, franchise taxes, and reporting requirements specific to the selected state (Delaware or Wyoming).

Foreign LLC Registration: Advice on the process and requirements for registering as a foreign LLC if I conduct business in my home state or other states where we plan to operate.

5. MONEY TRANSMITTER LICENSE REQUIREMENTS:

Federal and State Licensing: An overview of the steps necessary to obtain money transmitter licenses at both federal and state levels, including:
- FinCEN registration requirements
- State-by-state license requirements (particularly for states where users and venues are located)
- Compliance with AML/KYC regulations tailored to our business model
- How our escrow model and spending restrictions affect licensing requirements

6. ESCROW ACCOUNT LEGALITY:

Our business model involves holding user funds in escrow until redemption at venues. I need guidance on:
- Legality of holding funds indefinitely with no withdrawal option
- Regulatory requirements for escrow accounts
- Whether we need a separate escrow account or can use our business account
- Reserve requirements and bonding obligations

7. VIRTUAL CARD / TAP-AND-PAY COMPLIANCE:

We issue virtual cards via Stripe Issuing that can only be used at approved venues. Questions include:
- Do we need licenses to issue virtual cards?
- Is it legal to restrict where cards can be used?
- Consumer protection considerations for restricted spending

8. VENUE PORTAL AND OWNER PAGE COMPLIANCE:

Venue Management: The venue portal will allow participating venues to manage their profiles, payment settings, and customer interactions. Legal considerations include:
- Terms of service and user agreements for venues
- Venue onboarding and approval processes
- Data protection and privacy requirements
- Commission and fee structures

Data Protection: Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, particularly regarding:
- Customer data and transaction records accessible through the owner page
- GDPR and CCPA compliance
- Data retention and security requirements

9. SHOT ON ME PAGE CONSIDERATIONS:

User Experience: The customer-facing Shot On Me page will have features for transaction processing, user agreements, and fee disclosures. I seek guidance on:
- Necessary legal disclosures for users
- Terms of Service requirements (particularly regarding escrow, spending restrictions, and no withdrawal policy)
- Privacy Policy compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- Fee disclosure requirements
- Refund and dispute resolution policies

10. GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS ON SPENDING:

Our platform restricts spending to approved venues only. I need to understand:
- Legality of restricting where users can spend their money
- Consumer protection concerns
- Required disclosures to users
- Multi-state operation considerations

11. AML/KYC COMPLIANCE:

Given we facilitate money transfers and hold funds in escrow, I need guidance on:
- AML program requirements
- KYC verification requirements
- Transaction limits and monitoring
- Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) obligations
- Record-keeping requirements

12. TAX AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:

- 1099 filing requirements (for senders, recipients, venues?)
- Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) if transactions exceed $10,000
- Tax obligations for the platform
- Escrow interest tax implications

ATTACHED DOCUMENTATION:

I have prepared a comprehensive consultation document (ATTORNEY_CONSULTATION_GUIDE.md) that includes:
- Detailed business model overview
- Step-by-step payment flow diagrams
- Technical implementation details (Stripe Connect, Stripe Issuing)
- Specific legal questions organized by topic
- State-by-state considerations
- Risk assessment questions

This document is designed to help you understand our business model quickly and provide targeted legal advice.

- Cost estimates for compliance and licensing
- Timeline for obtaining necessary licenses and registrations

- Alternative business structures that might reduce regulatory burden
