Your Stripe and VAPID keys have been added to `backend/.env`.

## 🔑 Keys Added:

### Stripe (Payment Processing):

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Restart your backend server** (if it's running):

   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart:
   cd backend
   npm start
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the Stripe integration**:
   - Try adding a credit card through the API
   - Test adding funds to wallet
   - Use Stripe test cards (see STRIPE_SETUP.md)

## 🧪 Test Cards:

Use these test card numbers to verify everything works:
- **Visa**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Expiry**: `12/34`
- **CVC**: `123`

## 📡 API Endpoints Ready:

- `POST /api/payments/cards` - Add credit card
- `POST /api/payments/add-funds` - Add funds to wallet
- `GET /api/payments/cards` - List saved cards
- `DELETE /api/payments/cards/:id` - Delete card

## 🔒 Security Note:

Your `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`, so these keys won't be committed to version control. ✅
