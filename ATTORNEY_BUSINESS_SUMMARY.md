## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Shot On Me** is a social payment platform that enables users to send money to friends specifically for use at participating venues (bars, restaurants, clubs). Unlike traditional payment apps (Venmo, Cash App), Shot On Me:

1. **Holds funds in escrow** until redemption at venues
2. **Restricts spending** to approved venues only (no bank withdrawal)
3. **Uses virtual cards** (Stripe Issuing) for tap-and-pay at venues
4. **No app required** for recipients to receive funds (SMS-based)

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Fully functional platform (mobile app + venue portal + owner portal)
- ✅ Live at www.shotonme.com
- ✅ Payment processing integrated (Stripe)
- ⚠️ **Not yet accepting real payments** (awaiting legal compliance)

**Investment Required:** $50,000-$100,000 (initial compliance & launch)  
**Timeline to Launch:** 3-6 months (pending licenses)  
**Target Market:** 50M+ young adults (21-35) in US

## BUSINESS MODEL

### Core Functionality

**User Flow:**
1. User A sends $50 to User B via phone number
2. $50 is deducted from User A's wallet (or charged to credit card)
3. **$50 is held in platform's business bank account (escrow)**
4. User B receives SMS notification
5. User B's virtual card balance increases by $50
6. User B can only spend at participating venues (tap-and-pay)
7. When redeemed, $50 is transferred from platform to venue (minus 5-10% commission)

### Key Differentiators

- **Escrow Model:** Funds held until redemption (could be indefinite)
- **Spending Restrictions:** Only at approved venues (no bank withdrawal)
- **Virtual Cards:** Tap-and-pay via Stripe Issuing
- **Social Features:** Feed, location discovery, venue discovery
- **Venue Focus:** Specialized for venue experiences

### Revenue Streams

1. **Transaction Fees:** 2.5-2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (charged to sender)
2. **Venue Commissions:** 5-10% of redemption amount (charged to venue)
3. **Premium Subscriptions:** $4.99/month (optional, removes transaction fees)
4. **Venue Subscriptions:** $99-$299/month (future - analytics, promotion tools)

**Projected Year 1 Revenue:** $150,000-$300,000  
**Break-Even:** Month 9-12

## CRITICAL LEGAL QUESTIONS
